# 🛠️ Redux Toolkit Projects

This repository contains multiple **React + Redux Toolkit** projects that I’ve created while learning and experimenting with modern state management in React applications.  
Each project is built using the **Redux Toolkit** library to handle state in a clean, predictable, and scalable way.

## 📚 About Redux Toolkit
[Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) is the official, recommended way to write Redux logic.  
It provides:
- Simple store setup
- Fewer lines of boilerplate code
- Built-in tools like `createSlice`, `configureStore`, and `createAsyncThunk`
- A better developer experience

This repo will be updated as I create more projects with Redux Toolkit.

| Project Name | Description | Preview |

| **Counter App** | A simple counter app demonstrating `createSlice` for increment/decrement logic. | ![Counter Preview](./previews/counter.png) |
